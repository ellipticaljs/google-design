			/**
			 * @private Most other plugins (like BezierPlugin and ThrowPropsPlugin and others) can only tween numeric values, but CSSPlugin must accommodate special values that have a bunch of extra data (like a suffix or strings between numeric values, etc.). For example, boxShadow has values like "10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like "s" or "xn1" or "xn2") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like "boxShadow_xn1" and "boxShadow_xn2") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.
			 * This method returns an object that has the following properties:

			 *  - end: a generic object containing the ending values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin. This is what we feed to the external plugin's _onInitTween() as the destination values
			 *  - firstMPT: the first MiniPropTween in the linked list
			 *  - pt: the first CSSPropTween in the linked list that was created when parsing. If shallow is true, this linked list will NOT attach to the one passed into the _parseToProxy() as the "pt" (4th) parameter.

			/**
			 * @constructor Each property that is tweened has at least one CSSPropTween associated with it. These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of "extra" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where "s" indicates string and "n" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be "5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.
			 * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):
			 *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.
			 *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)
			 *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.
			 *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.
			 *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.
			 * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.
			 * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be "width".
			 * @param {number} s Starting numeric value
			 * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.
			 * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.
			 * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:"1px solid red"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.
			 * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a "clip:rect(...)" tween in which case "p" might be xs1 but "n" is still "clip"
			 * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded
			 * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order. Higher priority CSSPropTweens will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.
			 * @param {string=} b Beginning value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what it was when the tween began without any risk of interpretation issues.
			 * @param {string=} e Ending value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what the user defined at the end of the tween without any risk of interpretation issues.

If a plugin is defined, no child CSSPropTweens will be created. Instead, the ending values will be stored in the "data" property of the returned CSSPropTween like: {s:-5, xn1:-10, xn2:-20, xn3:255, xn4:0, xn5:0} so that it can be fed to any other plugin and it'll be plain numeric tweens but the recomposition of the complex value will be handled inside CSSPlugin's setRatio().
			 * If a setRatio is defined, the type of the CSSPropTween will be set to 2 and recomposition of the values will be the responsibility of that method.
			 *
			 * @param {!Object} t Target whose property will be tweened
			 * @param {!string} p Property that will be tweened (its name, like "left" or "backgroundColor" or "boxShadow")
			 * @param {string} b Beginning value

			 * @param {boolean} clrs If true, the value could contain a color value like "rgb(255,0,0)" or "#F00" or "red". The default is false, so no colors will be recognized (a performance optimization)
			 * @param {(string|number|Object)} dflt The default beginning value that should be used if no valid beginning value is defined or if the number of values inside the complex beginning and ending values don't match
			 * @param {?CSSPropTween} pt CSSPropTween instance that is the current head of the linked list (we'll prepend to this).
			 * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order. Higher priority properties will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.
			 * @param {TweenPlugin=} plugin If a plugin should handle the tweening of extra properties, pass the plugin instance here. If one is defined, then NO subtweens will be created for any extra properties (the properties will be created - just not additional CSSPropTween instances to tween them) because the plugin is expected to do so. However, the end values WILL be populated in the "data" property, like {s:100, xn1:50, xn2:300}
			 * @param {function(number)=} setRatio If values should be set in a custom function instead of being pieced together in a type:1 (complex-value) CSSPropTween, define that custom function here.

Every SpecialProp is associated with a particular property name like "boxShadow" or "throwProps" or "bezier" and it will intercept those values in the vars object that's passed to the CSSPlugin and handle them accordingly.
		 * @param {!string} p Property name (like "boxShadow" or "throwProps")
		 * @param {Object=} options An object containing any of the following configuration options:

		 *                      - parser: A function that should be called when the associated property name is found in the vars. This function should return a CSSPropTween instance and it should ensure that it is properly inserted into the linked list. It will receive 4 paramters: 1) The target, 2) The value defined in the vars, 3) The CSSPlugin instance (whose _firstPT should be used for the linked list), and 4) A computed style object if one was calculated (this is a speed optimization that allows retrieval of starting values quicker)
		 *                      - formatter: a function that formats any value received for this special property (for example, boxShadow could take "5px 5px red" and format it to "5px 5px 0px 0px red" so that both the beginning and ending values have a common order and quantity of values.)
		 *                      - prefix: if true, we'll determine whether or not this property requires a vendor prefix (like Webkit or Moz or ms or O)
		 *                      - color: set this to true if the value for this SpecialProp may contain color-related values like rgb(), rgba(), etc.
		 *                      - priority: priority in the linked list order. Higher priority SpecialProps will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.
		 *                      - multi: if true, the formatter should accommodate a comma-delimited list of values, like boxShadow could have multiple boxShadows listed out.
		 *                      - collapsible: if true, the formatter should treat the value like it's a top/right/bottom/left value that could be collapsed, like "5px" would apply to all, "5px, 10px" would use 5px for top/bottom and 10px for right/left, etc.
		 *                      - keyword: a special keyword that can [optionally] be found inside the value (like "inset" for boxShadow). This allows us to validate beginning/ending values to make sure they match (if the keyword is found in one, it'll be added to the other for consistency by default).

		 *  2) The end/destination value (could be a string, number, object, or whatever you want)
		 *  3) The tween instance (you probably don't need to worry about this, but it can be useful for looking up information like the duration)
		 *
		 * Then, your function should return a function which will be called each time the tween gets rendered, passing a numeric "ratio" parameter to your function that indicates the change factor (usually between 0 and 1). For example:
		 *
		 * CSSPlugin.registerSpecialProp("myCustomProp", function(target, value, tween) {
		 *      var start = target.style.width;
		 *      return function(ratio) {

		 *
		 * Then, when I do this tween, it will trigger my special property:
		 *
		 * TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}});
		 *
		 * In the example, of course, we're just changing the width, but you can do anything you want.
		 *
		 * @param {!string} name Property name (or comma-delimited list of property names) that should be intercepted and handled by your function. For example, if I define "myCustomProp", then it would handle that portion of the following tween: TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}})
		 * @param {!function(Object, Object, Object, string):function(number)} onInitTween The function that will be called when a tween of this special property is performed. The function will receive 4 parameters: 1) Target object that should be tweened, 2) Value that was passed to the tween, 3) The tween instance itself (rarely used), and 4) The property name that's being tweened. Your function should return a function that should be called on every update of the tween.

		 * is because it creates entirely new tweens that may have completely different targets than the original tween,
		 * so if they were all lumped into the original tween instance, it would be inconsistent with the rest of the API
		 * and it would create other problems. For example:
		 *  - If I create a tween of elementA, that tween instance may suddenly change its target to include 50 other elements (unintuitive if I specifically defined the target I wanted)
		 *  - We can't just create new independent tweens because otherwise, what happens if the original/parent tween is reversed or pause or dropped into a TimelineLite for tight control? You'd expect that tween's behavior to affect all the others.
		 *  - Analyzing every style property of every child before and after the tween is an expensive operation when there are many children, so this behavior shouldn't be imposed on all className tweens by default, especially since it's probably rare that this extra functionality is needed.

			/**
			 * @constructor
			 * Defines a GreenSock class, optionally with an array of dependencies that must be instantiated first and passed into the definition.
			 * This allows users to load GreenSock JS files in any order even if they have interdependencies (like CSSPlugin extends TweenPlugin which is
			 * inside TweenLite.js, but if CSSPlugin is loaded first, it should wait to run its code until TweenLite.js loads and instantiates TweenPlugin
			 * and then pass TweenPlugin to CSSPlugin's definition). This is all done automatically and internally.
			 *
			 * Every definition will be added to a "com.greensock" global object (typically window, but if a window.GreenSockGlobals object is found,
			 * it will go there as of v1.7). For example, TweenLite will be found at window.com.greensock.TweenLite and since it's a global class that should be available anywhere,
			 * it is ALSO referenced at window.TweenLite. However some classes aren't considered global, like the base com.greensock.core.Animation class, so
			 * those will only be at the package like window.com.greensock.core.Animation. Again, if you define a GreenSockGlobals object on the window, everything
			 * gets tucked neatly inside there instead of on the window directly. This allows you to do advanced things like load multiple versions of GreenSock
			 * files and put them into distinct objects (imagine a banner ad uses a newer version but the main site uses an older one). In that case, you could
			 * sandbox the banner one like:
			 *
			 * <script>
			 *     var gs = window.GreenSockGlobals = {}; //the newer version we're about to load could now be referenced in a "gs" object, like gs.TweenLite.to(...). Use whatever alias you want as long as it's unique, "gs" or "banner" or whatever.
			 * <\/script>
			 * <script src="js/greensock/v1.7/TweenMax.js"><\/script>
			 * <script>
			 *     window.GreenSockGlobals = window._gsQueue = window._gsDefine = null; //reset it back to null (along with the special _gsQueue variable) so that the next load of TweenMax affects the window and we can reference things directly like TweenLite.to(...)
			 * <\/script>
			 * <script src="js/greensock/v1.6/TweenMax.js"><\/script>
			 * <script>
			 *     gs.TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.7
			 *     TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.6
			 * <\/script>
			 *
			 * @param {!string} ns The namespace of the class definition, leaving off "com.greensock." as that's assumed. For example, "TweenLite" or "plugins.CSSPlugin" or "easing.Back".
			 * @param {!Array.<string>} dependencies An array of dependencies (described as their namespaces minus "com.greensock." prefix). For example ["TweenLite","plugins.TweenPlugin","core.Animation"]
			 * @param {!function():Object} func The function that should be called and passed the resolved dependencies which will return the actual class for this definition.
			 * @param {boolean=} global If true, the class will be added to the global scope (typically window unless you define a window.GreenSockGlobals object)

//	1. Enforce API surface and semantic compatibility with 1.9.x branch

//	3. Use the same single mechanism to support "private" and "user" data.
//	4. _Never_ expose "private" data to user code (TODO: Drop _data, _removeData)
//	5. Avoid exposing implementation details on user objects (eg. expando properties)
//	6. Provide a clear path for implementation upgrade to WeakMap in 2014

`iron-meta` is a generic element you can use for sharing information across the DOM tree.
It uses [monostate pattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MonostatePattern) such that any
instance of iron-meta has access to the shared
information. You can use `iron-meta` to share whatever you want (or create an extension
[like x-meta] for enhancements).

The `iron-meta` instances containing your actual data can be loaded in an import,
or constructed in any way you see fit. The only requirement is that you create them
before you try to access them.

Examples:

If I create an instance like this:

    <iron-meta key="info" value="foo/bar"></iron-meta>

Note that value="foo/bar" is the metadata I've defined. I could define more
attributes or use child nodes to define additional metadata.

Now I can access that element (and it's metadata) from any iron-meta instance
via the byKey method, e.g.

    meta.byKey('info').getAttribute('value');

Pure imperative form would be like:

    document.createElement('iron-meta').byKey('info').getAttribute('value');

Or, in a Polymer element, you can include a meta in your template:

    <iron-meta id="meta"></iron-meta>
    ...
    this.$.meta.byKey('info').getAttribute('value');

  /**
   * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit chaining.
   * Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections, and functions can
   * be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value or may return a
   * primitive value will automatically end the chain returning the unwrapped
   * value. Explicit chaining may be enabled using `_.chain`. The execution of
   * chained methods is lazy, that is, execution is deferred until `_#value`
   * is implicitly or explicitly called.
   *
   * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion. Shortcut
   * fusion is an optimization strategy which merge iteratee calls; this can help
   * to avoid the creation of intermediate data structures and greatly reduce the
   * number of iteratee executions.
   *
   * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
   * directly or indirectly included in the build.
   *
   * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
   *
   * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
   * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `reverse`, `shift`, `slice`, `sort`,
   * `splice`, and `unshift`
   *
   * The wrapper `String` methods are:
   * `replace` and `split`
   *
   * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
   * `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropRightWhile`, `dropWhile`, `filter`,
   * `first`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `pluck`, `reject`, `rest`, `reverse`,
   * `slice`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, `toArray`,
   * and `where`
   *
   * The chainable wrapper methods are:
   * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `at`, `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`,
   * `callback`, `chain`, `chunk`, `commit`, `compact`, `concat`, `constant`,
   * `countBy`, `create`, `curry`, `debounce`, `defaults`, `defaultsDeep`,
   * `defer`, `delay`, `difference`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropRightWhile`,
   * `dropWhile`, `fill`, `filter`, `flatten`, `flattenDeep`, `flow`, `flowRight`,
   * `forEach`, `forEachRight`, `forIn`, `forInRight`, `forOwn`, `forOwnRight`,
   * `functions`, `groupBy`, `indexBy`, `initial`, `intersection`, `invert`,
   * `invoke`, `keys`, `keysIn`, `map`, `mapKeys`, `mapValues`, `matches`,
   * `matchesProperty`, `memoize`, `merge`, `method`, `methodOf`, `mixin`,
   * `modArgs`, `negate`, `omit`, `once`, `pairs`, `partial`, `partialRight`,
   * `partition`, `pick`, `plant`, `pluck`, `property`, `propertyOf`, `pull`,
   * `pullAt`, `push`, `range`, `rearg`, `reject`, `remove`, `rest`, `restParam`,
   * `reverse`, `set`, `shuffle`, `slice`, `sort`, `sortBy`, `sortByAll`,
   * `sortByOrder`, `splice`, `spread`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`,
   * `takeWhile`, `tap`, `throttle`, `thru`, `times`, `toArray`, `toPlainObject`,
   * `transform`, `union`, `uniq`, `unshift`, `unzip`, `unzipWith`, `values`,
   * `valuesIn`, `where`, `without`, `wrap`, `xor`, `zip`, `zipObject`, `zipWith`
   *

   * `deburr`, `endsWith`, `escape`, `escapeRegExp`, `every`, `find`, `findIndex`,
   * `findKey`, `findLast`, `findLastIndex`, `findLastKey`, `findWhere`, `first`,
   * `floor`, `get`, `gt`, `gte`, `has`, `identity`, `includes`, `indexOf`,
   * `inRange`, `isArguments`, `isArray`, `isBoolean`, `isDate`, `isElement`,
   * `isEmpty`, `isEqual`, `isError`, `isFinite` `isFunction`, `isMatch`,
   * `isNative`, `isNaN`, `isNull`, `isNumber`, `isObject`, `isPlainObject`,

 * =============================================================
 * elliptical.document
 * =============================================================
 *    parses a form submission to a javascript POJO to be posted to an endpoint.
 *   the plugin handles broad cases of mapping a form to a model schema, including:
 *   (i) posting the form as an array or a deeply nested object
 *   (ii) checkbox handling, including posting boolean values for both checked and unchecked boxes
 *
 *   Note: the return object is not a json document.
 *   a json document can be constructed by simply calling JSON.stringify(which is usually handled by your js mvc framework).
 *   if you are not using a framework and manually invoking $.ajax(), you will need to stringify the return object
 *
 *   the idea is that the dev time is spent on form markup and not processing callbacks on submit captures
 *
 *   Most of the code culled from:
 *   SerializeJSON jQuery plugin.
 *   https://github.com/marioizquierdo/jquery.serializeJSON
 *  version 1.1.1 (Feb 16, 2014)
 *
 *  the method override for serializeArray() to include checkboxes as boolean values:
 *  http://tdanemar.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/jquery-serialize-method-and-checkboxes/
 *
 *  Final note: forms posted to the server-side controller action may not match client-side capture and post to json endpoint
 *  using this plugin due to different implementations by server-side frameworks re: array posts and checkboxes.

/**
`Polymer.IronFitBehavior` fits an element in another element using `max-height` and `max-width`, and
optionally centers it in the window or another element.

The element will only be sized and/or positioned if it has not already been sized and/or positioned
by CSS.

CSS properties               | Action
-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------
`position` set               | Element is not centered horizontally or vertically
`top` or `bottom` set        | Element is not vertically centered
`left` or `right` set        | Element is not horizontally centered
`max-height` set             | Element respects `max-height`
`max-width` set              | Element respects `max-width`

`Polymer.IronFitBehavior` can position an element into another element using
`verticalAlign` and `horizontalAlign`. This will override the element's css position.

      <div class="container">
        <iron-fit-impl vertical-align="top" horizontal-align="auto">
          Positioned into the container
        </iron-fit-impl>
      </div>

Use `noOverlap` to position the element around another element without overlapping it.

      <div class="container">
        <iron-fit-impl no-overlap vertical-align="auto" horizontal-align="auto">
          Positioned around the container
        </iron-fit-impl>

    /**
     * `Polymer.IronA11yKeysBehavior` provides a normalized interface for processing
     * keyboard commands that pertain to [WAI-ARIA best practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_general_binding).
     * The element takes care of browser differences with respect to Keyboard events
     * and uses an expressive syntax to filter key presses.
     *
     * Use the `keyBindings` prototype property to express what combination of keys
     * will trigger the callback. A key binding has the format
     * `"KEY+MODIFIER:EVENT": "callback"` (`"KEY": "callback"` or
     * `"KEY:EVENT": "callback"` are valid as well). Some examples:
     *
     *      keyBindings: {
     *        'space': '_onKeydown', // same as 'space:keydown'
     *        'shift+tab': '_onKeydown',
     *        'enter:keypress': '_onKeypress',
     *        'esc:keyup': '_onKeyup'
     *      }
     *
     * The callback will receive with an event containing the following information in `event.detail`:
     *
     *      _onKeydown: function(event) {
     *        console.log(event.detail.combo); // KEY+MODIFIER, e.g. "shift+tab"
     *        console.log(event.detail.key); // KEY only, e.g. "tab"
     *        console.log(event.detail.event); // EVENT, e.g. "keydown"
     *        console.log(event.detail.keyboardEvent); // the original KeyboardEvent
     *      }
     *
     * Use the `keyEventTarget` attribute to set up event handlers on a specific
     * node.
     *
     * See the [demo source code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-a11y-keys-behavior/blob/master/demo/x-key-aware.html)
     * for an example.

/**
Use `Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior` to implement an element that can be hidden or shown, and displays
on top of other content. It includes an optional backdrop, and can be used to implement a variety
of UI controls including dialogs and drop downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.

See the [demo source code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.html)
for an example.

### Closing and canceling

An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close and cancel is user
intent. Closing generally implies that the user acknowledged the content on the overlay. By default,
it will cancel whenever the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is
configurable with the `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties.
`close()` should be called explicitly by the implementer when the user interacts with a control
in the overlay element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay fires an 'iron-overlay-canceled'
event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to prevent the overlay from closing.

### Positioning

By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the window. You can
position and size it manually using CSS. See `Polymer.IronFitBehavior`.

### Backdrop

Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay. The backdrop is
appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`. See its doc page for styling
options.

In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the light DOM.
Override the [`_focusableNodes` getter](#Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior:property-_focusableNodes)
to achieve a different behavior.

### Limitations

The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its `z-index` property. You
must ensure no element has a stacking context with a higher `z-index` than its parent stacking
context. You should place this element as a child of `<body>` whenever possible.

/**
Use `Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior` and `paper-dialog-shared-styles.html` to implement a Material Design
dialog.

For example, if `<paper-dialog-impl>` implements this behavior:

    <paper-dialog-impl>
        <h2>Header</h2>
        <div>Dialog body</div>
        <div class="buttons">
            <paper-button dialog-dismiss>Cancel</paper-button>
            <paper-button dialog-confirm>Accept</paper-button>
        </div>
    </paper-dialog-impl>

`paper-dialog-shared-styles.html` provide styles for a header, content area, and an action area for buttons.
Use the `<h2>` tag for the header and the `buttons` class for the action area. You can use the
`paper-dialog-scrollable` element (in its own repository) if you need a scrolling content area.

Use the `dialog-dismiss` and `dialog-confirm` attributes on interactive controls to close the
dialog. If the user dismisses the dialog with `dialog-confirm`, the `closingReason` will update
to include `confirmed: true`.

### Accessibility

This element has `role="dialog"` by default. Depending on the context, it may be more appropriate
to override this attribute with `role="alertdialog"`.

If `modal` is set, the element will prevent the focus from exiting the element.
It will also ensure that focus remains in the dialog.

The `<iron-flex-layout>` component provides simple ways to use
[CSS flexible box layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes),
also known as flexbox. This component provides two different ways to use flexbox:

1. [Layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).
The layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules, that
let you specify layout properties directly in markup. You must include this file
in every element that needs to use them.

  Sample use:

      <link rel="import" href="../iron-flex-layout/iron-flex-layout-classes.html">
      <style is="custom-style" include="iron-flex iron-flex-alignment"></style>

      <div class="layout horizontal layout-start">
        <div>cross axis start alignment</div>
      </div>

2. [Custom CSS mixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html).
The mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS rule using the `@apply` function.

Please note that the old [/deep/ layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/classes)
are deprecated, and should not be used. To continue using layout properties
directly in markup, please switch to using the new `dom-module`-based
[layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).
Please note that the new version does not use `/deep/`, and therefore requires you
to import the `dom-modules` in every element that needs to use them.

A complete [guide](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/flex-layout) to `<iron-flex-layout>` is available.

Material design: [Dialogs](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dialogs.html)
`<md-dialog>` is a dialog with Material Design styling and optional animations when it is
opened or closed. It provides styles for a header, content area, and an action area for buttons.
You can use the `<paper-dialog-scrollable>` element (in its own repository) if you need a scrolling
content area. See `Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior` for specifics.
For example, the following code implements a dialog with a header, scrolling content area and
buttons.
    <md-dialog>
      <h2>Header</h2>
      <paper-dialog-scrollable>
        Lorem ipsum...
      </paper-dialog-scrollable>
      <div class="buttons">
        <paper-button dialog-dismiss>Cancel</paper-button>
        <paper-button dialog-confirm>Accept</paper-button>
      </div>
    </md-dialog>
### Styling
See the docs for `Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior` for the custom properties available for styling
this element.

`iron-a11y-announcer` is a singleton element that is intended to add a11y
to features that require on-demand announcement from screen readers. In
order to make use of the announcer, it is best to request its availability
in the announcing element.

Example:

    Polymer({

      is: 'x-chatty',

      attached: function() {
        // This will create the singleton element if it has not
        // been created yet:
        Polymer.IronA11yAnnouncer.requestAvailability();
      }
    });

After the `iron-a11y-announcer` has been made available, elements can
make announces by firing bubbling `iron-announce` events.

Example:

    this.fire('iron-announce', {
      text: 'This is an announcement!'
    }, { bubbles: true });

Note: announcements are only audible if you have a screen reader enabled.

Material design: [Snackbards & toasts](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/snackbars-toasts.html)

`paper-toast` provides a subtle notification toast. Only one `paper-toast` will
be visible on screen.

Use `opened` to show the toast:

Example:

    <paper-toast text="Hello world!" opened></paper-toast>

Also `open()` or `show()` can be used to show the toast:

Example:

    <paper-button on-click="openToast">Open Toast</paper-button>
    <paper-toast id="toast" text="Hello world!"></paper-toast>

    ...

    openToast: function() {
      this.$.toast.open();
    }

Set `duration` to 0, a negative number or Infinity to persist the toast on screen:

Example:

    <paper-toast text="Terms and conditions" opened duration="0">
      <a href="#">Show more</a>
    </paper-toast>


### Styling
The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--paper-toast-background-color` | The paper-toast background-color | `#323232`
