Elliptical Template
===========================

A Real-time dustjs MVC template provider. Allows on the fly template compilation for templates following the MVC convention of being placed in a views folder.
The template naming scheme relies on "dot" notation to identify the location within the tree hierarchy.

```bash
"home.index" --> ./views/home/index.html
"shared.cards.user" --> ./views/shared/cards/user.html

```
